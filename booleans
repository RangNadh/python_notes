-> True and False we will use in programming languages to know the expression right or wrong.

-> Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.

-> Any string is True, except empty strings.

-> Any number is True, except 0.

-> Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.

Examples:

a = 200
b = 33

if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not greater than a")

Output: b is not greater than a

-> print(bool("Hello"))   => True
   print(bool(15))        => True

def myFunction() :
  return True

if myFunction():
  print("YES!")
else:
  print("NO!")

Output: YES!

-> Some python built-in functions will return the boolean value

x = 200
print(isinstance(x, int))

Output: True

-> For all these expressions the output is same that is false.

bool(False)
bool(None)
bool(0)
bool("")                    Output: False
bool(())
bool([])
bool({})
